        <h2>WhoamI</h2>
        <p> Greetings, my name is Ricky Hayes. My professional journey began with humble roots in agricultural work, cultivating a strong work ethic and a penchant for hands-on tasks. Transitioning into my late teens, I embarked on a diverse career path, venturing into the realm of retail.</p>

<p>My early experiences spanned from assisting in a Chinese restaurant to contributing to the operations of a local Blockbuster establishment. These formative years instilled in me the values of diligence, adaptability, and customer service excellence.</p>

<p>As my career progressed, I delved into roles that demanded precision and attention to detail. From mastering the operation of forklifts to acquiring foundational safety knowledge in the controlled environment of a nuclear power plant, I continually embraced new challenges and opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>However, it was in the artistry of meat cutting that I found my true passion. With dedication and commitment, I honed my craft, striving for excellence in every cut and presentation.

<p>While my professional background lacked formal computer training, my innate curiosity and burgeoning interest in Cyber Security propelled me towards self-directed learning. I have embarked on a journey to broaden my skills, immersing myself in the realms of Python programming and Linux systems. Complementing this, I am currently undertaking a Google Cyber Security certification course to deepen my understanding of the field.</p>

<p>Through this website, I aspire to share my journey and insights, hoping to inspire others to pursue their passions and ambitions. May my experiences serve as a testament to the power of determination and the endless possibilities that await those who dare to dream.</p>
